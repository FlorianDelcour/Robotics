# Goal 
In this project, you will program a robotic agent that (i) gathers information about its environment using the sensors, (ii) plans a set of actions to respond appropriately to sensed data based on a pre-existing strategy, and (iii) executes a set of motor commands to carry out the actions that the plan calls for. The robot will be simulated in the robot simulator CoppeliaSim.
